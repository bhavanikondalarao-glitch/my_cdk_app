Recreate : It will delete all pods at a time and re-create all the pods at a time for update (there will be a downtime here)
Ramped / RollingUpdate : here we will delete some percentage pof pods and some percantege of pods will update 
Canary : we will take "n" number of pods and update them and test it , once we feel they are working , we will update all at a time,
here I can use two different versions at a time
Blue Green stretagey : We will create/replicate the cluster of old one and point load balancer to that (old cluster is green , new cluster is blue)

# 📘 **RollingUpdate Strategy — Definition**

**RollingUpdate is a Kubernetes Deployment strategy where old pods are gradually replaced by new pods in small batches.
This ensures zero-downtime because some pods stay running while others are updated.**

Two main settings control the speed and availability:

* **maxUnavailable** → How many pods can be unavailable (deleted) at the same time
* **maxSurge** → How many extra pods (above the desired count) Kubernetes can create during update

---

# 📦 **Example YAML**

```yaml
strategy:
  type: RollingUpdate
  rollingUpdate:
    maxUnavailable: 2
    maxSurge: 1
```

Desired replicas: **5**

---

# 📝 **Step-By-Step Explanation**

## ✅ **Initial State**

```
O O O O O   → 5 old pods running
```

---

## ⭐ **Step 1: Kubernetes applies RollingUpdate**

* Allowed to delete **2 pods** (maxUnavailable = 2)
* Allowed to create **1 extra new pod** (maxSurge = 1)

So K8s deletes 2 old pods:

```
O O O       (3 old left)
```

Then creates 1 new pod:

```
O O O N     (4 pods total)
```

---

## ⭐ **Step 2: Kubernetes tries to reach desired replicas**

Since we only have 4 pods (desired = 5),
Kubernetes creates one more **new** pod.

```
O O O N N   (5 total)
```

Now:

* 3 old pods
* 2 new pods

---

## ⭐ **Step 3: Kubernetes continues replacing**

Again, it can delete 2 old pods:

```
O       N N   (1 old left, 2 new → total 3 pods)
```

Then (because pod count is below 5),
Kubernetes creates 1 or 2 new pods until it reaches 5.

```
O N N N N   (5 pods again)
```

---

## ⭐ **Step 4: Final Replacement**

Delete the last old pod:

```
N N N N     (4 pods)
```

Then create one more new pod:

```
N N N N N   (final 5 new pods)
```

---

# 🎯 **Final State**

All old pods replaced by **5 new pods**,
without any downtime.

---

# 📌 **Key Takeaway to Remember**

**RollingUpdate = Replace in batches.
Some pods go down, some new ones come up.
App always stays available.**

* **maxUnavailable** controls how many old pods can be removed at once
* **maxSurge** controls how many extra new pods can be created temporarily

Where do we define RBAC?

👉 Everything is defined using YAML files

You usually create two YAML files:

One for permissions (Role)

One for assignment (RoleBinding)

4️⃣ Step A: Role YAML (WHAT they can do)

This file says:

“These actions are allowed on these resources”

apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: pod-reader
  namespace: development
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods"]
  verbs: ["get", "watch", "list"]

How to understand this clearly:

kind: Role
→ This is a namespace-level permission

namespace: development
→ Permission works ONLY inside this namespace

resources: ["pods"]
→ What they can access (pods)

verbs: ["get", "watch", "list"]
→ What actions they can do

get → see one pod

list → see all pods

watch → monitor changes

👉 This Role DOES NOT give access to anyone yet

5️⃣ Step B: RoleBinding YAML (WHO gets it)

This file says:

“Give this Role to this user”

apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: read-pods-binding
  namespace: development
subjects:
- kind: User
  name: "teammate@company.com"
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: pod-reader
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io

How this connects everything:

subjects → WHO

User = teammate@company.com

roleRef → WHAT

Role name = pod-reader

namespace: development

Binding works only in this namespace

👉 This is where the connection happens
User ⇄ Role

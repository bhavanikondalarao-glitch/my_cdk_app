⭐ The whole flow in one picture (simple)
1️⃣ You build a container → upload to ECR
2️⃣ You create EC2 → install Docker + ECS agent
3️⃣ ECS tells EC2: “Run this container”
4️⃣ EC2 downloads container image from ECR
5️⃣ EC2 runs the container using Docker

⭐ How Fargate Works (Simple Technical Flow)

Here is what changes:

❌ No EC2
❌ No Docker install
❌ No ECS agent
❌ No OS patching
❌ No scaling servers
✔ You only create:

A Task Definition

A Service

Use Launch Type = FARGATE

Fargate takes care of everything under the hood.
